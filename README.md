Squares is a simple game where the main goal is to make lines of 3 squares, and get points. If you make a line of 3 squares you will get 100 points, or if you don’t make a line 5 new squares in 5 random colors will appear on the screen.  So at the beginning there are 5 colors, and 5 squares are added if no you don’t make a line. Also there is timer, with countdown of 2 minutes. When the countdown is over new color is added and the number of squares added if you don’t make a line is increased by one. The maximum number of colors and squares added is 8.<br><br>

In the game there are also some weapons like Bomb, Sword, and Freezer. The bomb destroys all the squares around the square that is selected, also including the selected square, getting many points. With the sword you can destroy squares horizontal and vertical from the square that is selected. And the freezer freezes the countdown time to 10 seconds. All of these weapons can be used once in a game.<br><br>

You can get combo by making many lines in a row. Minimum number of lines is 3. So for example if you make combo of 5 lines in a row, you will get plus 500 points from the combo.<br><br>
Also not that, to make a move or to get a square from one place to another you must have a path. If you don’t have a path, no move will be made.<br><br>
And finally when the screen is full with colored squares and you can’t make a move, the game is over.<br><br>
